#' Specialize the R's native nls class to fitting scaling models
#'
#' SATK is set of functions and calls that aid the performance analysis 
#' fitting data to a variety of scaling models. Currently, scale_fit is used as
#' a base class to support fitting: Amdalh's,  Gustafson's law, and Gunther's 
#' Universal Scaling Law. 
#' 
#' The package also introduces an extension to the R list object that's used
#' to groups sfit objects all fitted from the same measured data.
